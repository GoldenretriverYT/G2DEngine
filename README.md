# G2DEngine
G2D is a work in progress 2D game engine written in purely C# (using SkiaSharp &amp; SILK.NET)

### Getting Started
To get started, you will have to clone the repository as there currently is no working editor.<br>
The project "G2DEngine.Runtime.TestPreEditor" is an example project. However, this example project constantly changes as its real purpose is for testing as long as there is no editor.

### Cross-Platform
Whilst it probably wouldn't be hard, considering Silk.NET and SkiaSharp already work cross-platform, G2D currently only supports 64-bit Windows. Building the project
for linux might work without any changes, but any issues related to this are currently not the priority.

### Note
As for almost all my projects, this is just a project I started for fun. It is not supposed to become one of the big engines and I can't gurantee that I will maintain it forever.<br><br>
And yes, G2D is slightly inspired by Unitys GameObject/Components/Transform architecture.
